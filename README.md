For all these problems, find the rejection region, the value of the test statistic and the P-value of the test.  
1) In a study of the size of various computer systems, the random variable X, the number of files stored (in hundreds of thousands), is considered. If a computer system cannot store at least 9, on average, it does not meet the efficiency standard and has to be replaced. These data are obtained: 7 7 4 5 9 9 4 12 8 1 8 7 3 13 2 1 17 7 12 5 6 2 1 13 14 10 2 4 9 11 3 5 12 6 10 7
- a) Assuming that past experience indicates that σ=5, at the 5% significance level, does the data suggest that the standard is met? What about at 1%?
- b) Without the assumption on σ, does the data suggest that, on average, the number of files stored exceeds 5.5?  (same significance level)

2) It  is  thought  that  the  gas  mileage  obtained  by  a  particular  model  of  automobile will be higher if unleaded premium gasoline is used in the vehicle rather than regular unleaded gasoline. To gather evidence in this matter, 10 cars are randomly selected from the assembly line and tested using a specified brand of premium gasoline; 10 others are randomly selected and tested using the brand’s regular gasoline. Tests are conducted under identical controlled conditions and gas mileages for both types of  gas  are  assumed  independent  and  (approximately)  normally  distributed. These data result: Premium: 22.4 21.7 24.5 23.4 21.6 23.3 22.4 21.6 24.8 20.0 and Regular: 17.7 14.8 19.6 19.6 12.1 14.8 15.4 12.6 14.0 12.2.
- a) At  the  5%  significance  level, is  there evidence that the variances of the two populations are equal?
- b) Based on the result in part a), at the same significance level, does gas mileage seem to be higher, on average, when premium gasoline is used?
